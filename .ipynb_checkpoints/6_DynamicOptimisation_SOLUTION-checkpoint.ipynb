    "# 6 Dynamic Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture we have learned analytic methods to solve optimal control problems, i.e. we solved them using purely mathematical techniques, with pen and paper. Many problems may however not be analytically solvable, if the problems become more complex. In that case, we resort to numerical optimisation methods. The advantage of using a computer is that we can run thousands of calculations in a very short time, so it allows us to try out a certain time path for our control and state variables, and then iterate towards some optimal solution. The key challenge is to design methods that converge relatively fast, i.e. with relatively few steps of calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn to implement one such algorithm, the forward-backward-sweep method. There are many possible variations and extensions of it, but if you understand the principles of the core framework, it should be relatively easy for you to learn how to implement those by yourselves. <font color='red'>*Brief overview of algorithm. Two options: fixed terminal state $x_T$, or free terminal state, work with transversality condition. As this is a bit more involved, we only consider the simplest case, where $mu(T)=0$ applies.  Cite article which this is based on.*</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than viewing the one algorithm here as a go-to solution for any optimisation problem you may come across in the future (other classes, thesis, work...), this should serve as an introduction to the general idea of iteratively searching for an optimal solution to a given problem, be it optimisation, estimation, or anything else. After all, the general idea of starting from a (random) initial guess and somehow converge to some optimum applies not only to our abstract academic problems in class, but also forms the core of many machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a sidenote, it may be worthwhile to mention that one very common method to address dynamic optimisation, both analytically and numerically, is dynamic programming. It could be useful for you to look into this subject at some point, if you are interested in this topic. In this class, I have conciously avoided it htough, as it would require the introduction of new theoretical concepts, which is not the purpose of this PC tutorial. "

    "To solve this numerically, we first have to discretise the continuous-time system, creating $N+1$ points in time, with $dt=\\frac{T-t_0}{N}$. Now we start with an initial guess for the time path of the control variable $u^{(0)}$ (superscript denotes iteration number of our algorithm) and use this guess to solve the dynamics of the state variable $x$ *forward* in time, starting from the initial condition. We can use any of the methods from the last three tutorials, but the Runge-Kutta timestepping methods is really the standard here. Having solved the time path of the state variable, and given our initial guess of the control variable, we can now use the $(ii)$, with a starting value from $(iv)$ to solve the time path of $\\mu$ *backwards*. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have the initial guesses for the time paths of all three variables of interest. However, there is no reason to assume that this initial guess is actually optimal. Hence, we can use FOC $(i)$ to satisfy the optimality condition of our control variable $u$. This can be done with a simple Newton-type method of finding the roots of an equation. As we are finding the roots of the derivative, it means we will ultimately find a (local) optimum. In practice, it means that we iterate through the values of $u(t), t\\in[0, dt, ..., T]$, solve for the roots of the FOC at that point in time, and update our guess to $u^{(1)}$. Often, we do not step fully towards the optimum, but only some part of the way, i.e. we set $u^{(k+1)} \\leftarrow (1-\\omega) u^{(k)} + \\omega \\hat{u}^{(k+1)}$. This avoids potential instability in the convergence behaviour through overshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then start over with this updated guess $u^{(1)}$ for the control variable to re-estimate the time paths for $x$ and $\\mu$ and proceed through the same steps over and over again. We stop when some convergence criterion has been reached, or when we meet a maximum number of iterations, which we typically set in case we cannot reach convergence (we do not want the computer to run forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are quite a few steps involved, but we will break up the problem into smaller components and go through it step by step. Many of the methods we use are already known to you by now, so I hope the combination of several of these does not appear too daunting at this point. First, we set up a Hamiltonian, then write functions to differentiate numerically, create the timestepping functions for $x$ and $\\mu$ using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta iterator, and then we implement the Newton algorithm to optimise the control variable. Finally, we put it all together to solve the problem that is given below."

We start with an initial amount (small plants a tthe beginning of the season) $x(0) = x_0$ abd have an indeterminate (free) final state $x(T)$ at the end of the growing season. Hence, we want to grow as much as is economically optimal.
