    "# 6 Dynamic Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture we have learned analytic methods to solve optimal control problems, i.e. we solved them using purely mathematical techniques, with pen and paper. Many problems may however not be analytically solvable, if the problems become more complex. In that case, we resort to numerical optimisation methods. The advantage of using a computer is that we can run thousands of calculations in a very short time, so it allows us to try out a certain time path for our control and state variables, and then iterate towards some optimal solution. The key challenge is to design methods that converge relatively fast, i.e. with relatively few steps of calculation. Much of the explanation in this tutorial, as well as the practice problem is based on Sharp et al. (2021), which is a good overview of the basic method, as well as a few extensions to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn to implement one such algorithm, the forward-backward-sweep method. There are many possible variations and extensions of it, but if you understand the principles of the core framework, it should be relatively easy for you to learn how to implement those by yourselves. The algorithm essentially starts with a \"guess\" about the optimal solution for the control variable, and based on this guess then iterates the state variable forward in time, starting from the initial condition $x(0)=x_0$. This is a straightforward application of any timestepping scheme from the previous tutorials (in practice typically the fourth-order Runge-Kutta) on the state equation. In case there is no terminal condition (and if it is relatively clear that $x(T) \\neq 0$), we can then iterate the co-state variable, the shadow price, *backwards* from $\\mu(T)=0$. Similarly, if a final function $F(x(T), T)$ is given, we know that $\\mu(T) = \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}_{t=T}$, so we iterate backwards from that value. This provides initial guesses for the state and co-state variables, which might be far from the optimal solution still. However, we can, based on these guesses and the first-order conditions, optimise the control variable and improve upon this first guess of the control variable. With this improved guess we can now start from the beginning and run these three steps (forward iteration of state variable, backward iteration of co-state, optimisation of control) over and over again until the algorithm converges. If a desired terminal state $x(T)=x_T$ is given, or if it is not quite clear whether $\\mu(T)=0$ or $x(T)=0$ (recall the condition $x(T)\\mu(T)=0$ in absence of a terminal condition), other methods need to be added. This tutorial is only meant to be a brief and gentle introduction to the topic however, so we will focus on the most basic version, where $\\mu(T)=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While quite a few steps are involved in solving this problem, it is mainly a combination of techniques we already know from the previous tutorials. We will take it step by step to keep it as simple as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than viewing the one algorithm here as a go-to solution for any optimisation problem you may come across in the future (other classes, thesis, work...), this should serve as an introduction to the general idea of iteratively searching for an optimal solution to a given problem, be it optimisation, estimation, or anything else. After all, the general idea of starting from a (random) initial guess and to somehow converge to an optimum applies not only to our abstract academic problems in class, but also forms the core of many machine learning algorithms.\n",

    "To solve this numerically, we first have to discretise the continuous-time system, creating $N+1$ points in time, with $dt=\\frac{T-t_0}{N}$. Now we start with an initial guess for the time path of the control variable $u^{(0)}$ (superscript denotes iteration number of our algorithm) and use this guess to solve the dynamics of the state variable $x$ *forward* in time, starting from the initial condition. We can use any of the methods from the last three tutorials, but the Runge-Kutta timestepping methods is really the standard here. Having solved the time path of the state variable, and given our initial guess of the control variable, we can now use the $(ii)$, with a starting value from $(iv)$ to solve the time path of $\\mu$ *backwards*. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we have the initial guesses for the time paths of all three variables of interest. However, there is no reason to assume that this initial guess is actually optimal. Hence, we can use FOC $(i)$ to satisfy the optimality condition of our control variable $u$. This can be done with a simple Newton-type method of finding the roots of an equation. As we are finding the roots of the derivative, it means we will ultimately find a (local) optimum. In practice, it means that we iterate through the values of $u(t), t\\in[0, dt, ..., T]$, solve for the roots of the FOC at that point in time, and update our guess to $u^{(1)}$. Often, we do not step fully towards the optimum, but only some part of the way, i.e. we set $u^{(k+1)} \\leftarrow (1-\\omega) u^{(k)} + \\omega \\hat{u}^{(k+1)}$. This avoids potential instability in the convergence behaviour through overshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then start over with this updated guess $u^{(1)}$ for the control variable to re-estimate the time paths for $x$ and $\\mu$ and proceed through the same steps over and over again. We stop when some convergence criterion has been reached, or when we meet a maximum number of iterations, which we typically set in case we cannot reach convergence (we do not want the computer to run forever).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, there are quite a few steps involved, but we will break up the problem into smaller components and go through it step by step. Many of the methods we use are already known to you by now, so I hope the combination of several of these does not appear too daunting at this point. First, we set up a Hamiltonian, then write functions to differentiate numerically, create the timestepping functions for $x$ and $\\mu$ using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta iterator, and then we implement the Newton algorithm to optimise the control variable. Finally, we put it all together to solve the problem that is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything will be implemented quite generally, so that the program should be able to solve any other optimisation problem where $\\mu(T)=0$. You only have to adjust the Hamiltonian and the state equation."

We start with an initial amount (small plants a the beginning of the season) $x(0) = x_0$ and have an indeterminate (free) final state $x(T)$ at the end of the growing season. Hence, we want to grow as much as is economically optimal.

Then we start our iterative algorithm: first create the time series of the state variable, iterating it forward with `N` Runge-Kutta steps, then we do the same backwards for the co-state. Before we optimise the control variable we store the current value in a separate array as a copy, so once it is optimised, we can compare and check if they differ at all. If they are extremely similar (here we check the Euclidean norm of the difference of both \"vectors\"), we conclude that the algorithm has converged and break out of the loop. Finally, we return the result."
