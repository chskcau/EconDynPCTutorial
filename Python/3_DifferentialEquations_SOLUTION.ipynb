    "# 3 Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between difference equations and differential equations is that the former model a system in discrete time, i.e. the evolution between one point in time and the next, while the latter model a system in continuous time. This raises an important issue for simulations of such models: computers only work in discrete states (1 & 0, ultimately), so \"true\" continuity cannot be implemented. Hence, we have to work with approximations. Usually that creates a trade-off between accuracy (how close is the solutions to the true, e.g. analytically derived solution?) and computational efficiency (how much work does the computer  have to do, and how long is it going to take?).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, two different timestepping methods will be introduced:  explicit Euler method and the Runge's central difference quotient method. You will write functions to simulate the behaviour of a first-order differential equation. We can then compare the accuracy of both solutions by calculating the errors relative to the analytical solution, and also plot the behaviour of the system over time."

    "Note how the distance from the green (upper) line to the exact solution (red line in the middle) is much smaller than the distance of the Euler method to the analytical solution. Moreover, you can clearly see another property of the Euler method: In the case of a convex function $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}>0$ as the present one, the slope is exaggerated, i.e. in the case of a positive (negative) coefficient, we would obtain a positive (negative) bias. We only approximate the slope at the current point and and take a step $dt=\\delta$ along this slope. However, the slope is changing (non-zero second derivative, i.e. the rate of change is changing), and therefore at any point between $t$ and $t+\\delta$, the slope would already be different, which we ignore, leading to small approximation errors. The central difference methodobtains a more accurate representation of the true behaviour of the system, as it applies the slope in the middle, which is closer to the average slope over the entire distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play around with the values of $n, \\delta$ and see how they change the behaviour of the approximation. For values $n>10$ it the difference between Runge's method and the exact solution quickly become invisible, while it takes a bit longer with the EUler method. You might also note a curious error source for $n\\leq2$, which we will address in the next tutorial."
